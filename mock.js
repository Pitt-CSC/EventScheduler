In recent years, many computer professionals have become increasingly aware of the societal impacts of the increased use of computer technology in everyday life. While technology promises many benefits to our society and economy, there are also well founded concerns that serious problems may arise. This course is intended to introduce students to the main issues surrounding the computerization of society, and to help students understand the development, application, and consequences of information technology as social as well as technical processes. Topics include computerization and the quality of work life, unemployment, personal privacy and freedom of information, ownership and rights to software, and the manageability, risks and accountability of complex systems. The course seeks to foster in students a critical approach to the understanding of the impact of technology in society via the academic skills of reading, writing and argumentation. The course is designed to meet the program WRIT requirement for CS majors. "

    "description": "This course is intended to expose students to issues regarding the social and ethical implications of technology. In recent years, many computer professionals have become increasingly aware of the societal impacts of the increased use of computer technology in everyday life. While technology promises many benefits to our society and economy, there are also well founded concerns that serious problems may arise. This course is intended to introduce students to the main issues surrounding the computerization of society, and to help students understand the development, application, and consequences of information technology as social as well as technical processes. Topics include computerization and the quality of work life, unemployment, personal privacy and freedom of information, ownership and rights to software, and the manageability, risks and accountability of complex systems. The course seeks to foster in students a critical approach to the understanding of the impact of technology in society via the academic skills of reading, writing and argumentation. The course is designed to meet the program WRIT requirement for CS majors. "

The course is structured to familiarize students with base standards, like NIST, and more specific cybersecurity and privacy requirements to help students understand how those requirements are met, using frameworks, controls, and training.  Group activities and homework will enable students to apply some of the concepts taught in class to a real-life situation. At the end of the course, students are required to work on a project where they apply skills gained through their studies at the Computer Science department with the knowledge learned in this class. Furthermore, students in this class learn how to develop an organizationâs information security policy and procedures to comply with government and industry regulations.

This introductory machine learning course will give an overview of many models and algorithms used in modern machine learning, including generalized linear models, multi-layer neural networks, support vector machines, density estimation methods, Bayesian belief networks, mixture models, clustering, ensample methods, and reinforcement learning. The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition behind these methods, as well as, a more formal understanding of how and why they work.
